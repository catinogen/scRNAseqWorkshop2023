## Downloading the necessary files

Make sure that you've downloaded a zip of the github repo https://github.com/yerkes-gencore/scRNAseqWorkshop2023 and unzip it somewhere on your computer (e.g. in your `Desktop` directory).

If you want to keep working in the directory you created last class, simple copy and paste the `05_multi-sample` folder into the base level of your existing directory.

If you'd like to start fresh in a clean working directory, you can simply work from the newly unzipped folder.

*Note: If you are comfortable using git (beyond the scope of this workshop) and are already working within a local clone of the repo, you can skip the above and simply `git pull` the repo.*
